 # Assistive Switch Testing System - CG65

<!--- 
SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
We are from UBC ECE Capstone Group CG65 and our project is to build a cost-effective test system for engineers to test the assistive switch for Neil Squire's Program Makers Making Change. The testing system is made from modifying a commercially available 3D printer, low cost electrical components, 3D printed parts and specially designed user interface.

## Getting Started
<!--- 
Include an overall idea of what major steps are required to build the device.
 --->

### 1. Order the 3D printer
Our testing system will be assembled on a 3D printer. For our project, we've chosen the Ender 3 V2 from [3D Printing Canada](https://3dprintingcanada.com/products/creality-ender-3-v2) since it is CSA and ETL safety certified. So far, this testing system has been implemented on an Ender 3 V2 and you can acquire the same model from any available store.

### 2. Order and assemble the PCB
The PCB will be used to receive and send signals from the load cell and switch to a computer.

All of the files and documentation can be found in the [/Hardware/PCB](/Hardware/PCB) folder.

### 3. Order and assemble the force sensor

The force sensor includes the load cell and its adapter. It will be used to send signals to the PCB during a testing routine.

All of the documentation can be found in the [/Hardware/Sensor](/Hardware/Sensor) folder. Individual print files of the adapter can be found in [/Hardware/Adapters and Jigs/Load Cell Adapter](/Hardware/Adapters and Jigs/Load Cell Adapter)
